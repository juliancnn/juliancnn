I’m a **Software Engineer and Team Technical Lead** with extensive experience in **C++ (C++17)**, distributed systems, and low-level engineering on Linux. I lead the **design and development of Wazuh-Engine**, the next-generation core module for the Wazuh open-source security platform, combining architecture decisions, high performance, and code quality.

🔭 I’m currently focused on:
- Core infra & micro-architecture design for Wazuh-Engine.
